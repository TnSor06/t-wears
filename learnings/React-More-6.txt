1. Don't Over Complicate
    - Lines of code != Good Developer
    - Readability
    - Don't follow trend to go to best technology. You should understand what you are doing.
2. Be A Late Follower
    - Tools evolve
    - Learn new tools but don't implement just because it is new.
3. Break Down things
    - Make component simpler and break it further so that each component does only one thing
    - Structure file because more component needs to be structured.
4. Things are never perfect
    - Productivity reduces if you go for perfection.
    - Build then brush it later.
    - Improve based on feedback

Progressive Web Apps.
    - Webpage interaction with Native App features
    - Web App HTML, CSS, JS.
    - Push Notification, Offline Mode, Geolocation, Access to Phone Hardware.
    - Create React App creates PWA out of the box.
    - Use Lighthouse chrome plugin
    1. HTTPS:
        - Encrypted Data and middleman cannot retrieve data
        - Let's Encrypt, Cloudflare is a free open certificate authority
    2. App Manifest
        - "manifest.json" 
        - favicon image generator
        - Preview and Custom Splash screen
    3. Service Worker
        - Script browser runs in background for features that dont need web page to work with
        - Allow us to control what happens on request-to-request basis
        - Offline Experience and Push Notification
        - regiterserviceworker in index.js and serviceworker file
        - Acts as a network proxy and intercepts request to check if he has the file rather than fetching from network
        - Cache API is where files are stored which are fetched by serviceworker.js
        - Check "sw-precache" lib
        a. Register service worker in  react and pass js file from server if we are unable to pass it from the server
        b. Update App's Manifest to our purpose and data
        c. Redirect http request to https (For server end "npm i express-sslify" and use it in express)
